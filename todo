What to do to make wherebls as build-lib (currently it is
globalvar  $rchbls = fubarbls
build-lib - $HOME/wherebls
exec-lib  - $HOME/fubarbls

make local backup
1.  by local using copy
cp -rv ~/wherebls/. ~/blswhere

verify by  match every file output  with match every file having
the word 'identical' output

diff -rs ~/wherebls ~/blswhere | wc
diff -rs ~/wherebls ~/blswhere | grep 'identical' | wc
  --------------------------------------------------------
2. Use git on local dir
(gotten by history > file  (remember the nice history cmd)
 

 ( create a local place to put the data)
 2238  cd wherebls
 2239  git remote -v
 2241  git remote add online ~/whereblsgitsave
 2242  git remote -v
 2243  mkdir ~/whereblsgitsave

 ( prep the new directory )
 2244  cd whereblsgitsave
 2245  cd 
 2246  cd whereblsgitsave
 2247  git init --bare

 ( PUSH all commited data)
 2248  cd ~/wherebls
 2249  git push -u online
 ( check the results )
 2250  cd
 2251  git clone ~/whereblsgitsave whereblsextra
 ( verify ) 
 2253  diff -rs ~/wherebls ~/whereblsextra | wc
 2254  diff -rs ~/wherebls ~/whereblsextra | grep 'identical' | wc

 Oh NO they don't mathch.    Let me think.
 Oh yet  I only pushed up the commited data not changes

do a  'git status'
