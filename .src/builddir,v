  The first word in the first line (by default 'whereis') is
the directory which contains build code. 

So default build library is   $HOME/whereis

If you change the value to 'xxxx' then you should be in
$HOME/xxx/builddir

Obtained by: git clone https://github.com/rchanse/whereis.git

To get the xxx lib you can issue
 git clone https://github.com/rchanse/whereis.git xxx

IMPORTANT: if you changed the build lib make the change in line 1.
This build lib is only used in INSTALL and refresh.
