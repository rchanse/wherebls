This project born out of inability to type, remember, and laziness.

It has three parts.
 a. A library of piece to make (build) the running system (buildlib)
    It's name is (when built) the first word in member  builddir.
 b. A library of 'executing' code (execlib).  It's name is (when
    built) the first word in member  execdir.
 c. A single global variable set during the build.  It is $rchbls.
    This will allow the 'system' to find it's way arround the
    software.  Gotta have some kind of anchor and I choose  $rchbls
    (rch - Robert C. Hansen    bls - Benjamin Lafayette Sisco )
    (and NO - I decided NOT to use Ben Sisco - making  $rchbs   )

There are two main function (and their generalizations)
 a. f - used to find files by user chosen acronyms.
 b. g - used to find files by number.

There will also be some modest amount of 'git'  and a baby soure 
maintenance system called 'src' provided by ESR (Eric S Raymond
author of 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar' which you may google and
download for 'free'.  ESR is always a 'fun' read.   'src' is a
fairly sizeable python )

INSTALLation
1. down load the git repository which you have like done to get here.
    git clone https://github.com/rchanse/whereisit.git
2. 'cd whereisit'        (this will be the builddir
3. '. ./setvar'
4. '. ./INSTALL'
5. 'cd to-the-execlib-dir   ( default is  'cd ~/fubar'
6. '. ./engage'
   ( you are now started and ready to go) 

Srart the whereis system after Installation
1.  'cd  execdir'        (again default is  'cd ~/fubar'
2.  '. ./engage'

OK - lets go and doit

BTW: "Here's the deal!" seems to most recently associated with
Joseph Biden.  FWIW.
