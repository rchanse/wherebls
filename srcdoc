Concerns Eric S Raymond's (src) Simple Revision Control
I hope you like to read.  google 'esr src software'

source location:https://gitlab.com/esr/src
 you can get it by git clone https://gitlab.com/esr/src.git

a python pgm : src place it in your PATH libs.

"Pre-reqs"
a.   This is built on old unix source control systems rcs and sccs
     install the gnu flavors of them
b.  sudo apt-get install rcs
c.  sudo apt-get install cssc

Optional: sudo apt-get asciidoc (takes long to get and 1.5 G of space
 I did not do it and have yet to see problems.

Try this:

1. enter 'src'        shows cmds
2.        src help intro
3.        src help revisions
4.        src help commands
5.        src help commit

Good luck


little example - make file, save/track it, mod it, retrieve orig

a. make a new directory  
b. cd to the newdir
c. make your own "hello, world" script (say 'howdy')
  2 line text of howdy
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Howdy, world"

chmod +x howdy
./howdy
make sure it works
 ( enter ls -alR 
src commit -m "original ver." howdy
 ( enter ls -alR               note the .src directory
src log            or  src log howdy
go change the 'hello' msg in howdy
re-test 'new ver' of howdy
src diff howdy
src commit -m 'new howdy msg' howdy
 (Now you want orig ver back
 src checkout 1 howdy
 cat howdy


NOTE after the first commit you will have a new hidden dir  .src
where info is kept.   Use  ls -R
